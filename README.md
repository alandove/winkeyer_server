winkeyer_server
===============

This is a UDP server that allows operation of the Winkey USB by K1EL with any Linux program with UDP keyer capability. It works in the same way as the popular cwdaemon. With a Winkeyer USB, the server expands the useability of this excellent product to all Linux programs with UDP keyer capability, including the TLF contest logger by PA0R.

# Installation
